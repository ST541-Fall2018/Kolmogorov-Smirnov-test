# Milestones:

**To answer the first question (Is the Kolmogorov Smirnov (KS) test an asymptotically exact test for testing the means of two distributions):**

  * Simulate samples with different sample sizes from two distributions with the same means but different CDFs and investigate if ks test is an asymptotically exact test for testing the means.
  

**To answer the second question (Is the Kolmogorov Smirnov (KS) test an asymptotically consistent test for testing the means of two distributions):**

  * Simulate samples with different sample sizes from two distributions with different means and some CDFs and investigate if ks test is an asymptotically consistent test for testing the means.
  

### Week5
  
    * Do some simulations on some distributions with the same means but different distributions. The distributions could be:
      * normal
      * exponential
      * poison
      * gamma
      * beta
    
### Week 6

    * Perform ks test in R on the simulated distributions and see if rejection rate converges to the alpha level for different settings.

### Week 7

    * Do some simulations on some distributions with different means. The distributions could be:
      * normal
      * exponential
      * poison
      * gamma
      * beta

### Week 8

    * Perform ks test in R on the simulated distributions and see if power converges to 1 for different settings as sample size goes to infinity.
      
### Week 9
    
    * Preparing the report
    
### Week 10
    
    * Preparing the powerpoint and the presentation
