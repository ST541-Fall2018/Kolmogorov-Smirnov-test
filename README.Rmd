## Description of the project:

This project intends to answer the following questions using simulation:

  1. Is the Kolmogorov Smirnov (KS) test an asymptotically exact test for testing the means of two
    distributions.
  2. Is the Kolmogorov Smirnov (KS) test an asymptotically consistent test for testing the means of two distributions.
  
## Findings

  * The KS test is not asymptotically exact for testing the population means
  * The KS test is asymptotically efficient for testing the population means
