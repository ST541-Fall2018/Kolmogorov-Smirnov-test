## Project title: 

    Using kolmogorov smirnov test to compare the means

## Description of the project:

    This project intends to answer the following questions using simulation:
    1. Is the kolmogorov smirnov (KS) test an asymptotically exact test for testing the means of two
    distributions.
    2. Is the kolmogorov smirnov (KS) test an asymptotically consistent test for testing the means of two distributions # haddadis-HW4-project.
